# Competitive Programming Algorithms 
#### By Raymond Li (Raymo111) & James (magicalsoup)
Please feel free to contribute by helping to port some of [@espidev](https://github.com/espidev) and [@jimgao1](https://github.com/jimgao1)'s algorithms over to Java from C++:
> https://gitlab.com/EspiDev/Algorithms \
> https://github.com/jimgao1/competitive-programming/tree/master/Algorithms

This set of algorithms contains levels ranging from easy to advanced. 

Please read https://github.com/magicalsoup/CCC-Junior-Prep to get a better understanding in the field of competitive programming, such as time complexity and memory allocation.

All algorithms should contain a ```README.md``` file, explaining how the algorithm works, with a file labled either as ```main.java``` or the algortihm's name + ```.java``` showing an implmentation of the algorithm idea.

We will try to start translating some of the algorithms into other languages such as python and c++, but for now, its all done in java. Sorry for the inconvience.
