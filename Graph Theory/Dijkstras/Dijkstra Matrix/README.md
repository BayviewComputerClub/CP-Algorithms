# Dijkstras

Dijkstras is an algorithm that finds the shortest path between 2 nodes in a weighted graph. 

This algorithm runs in O(N<sup>2</sup>) time, but can be optimized.

The algorithm works by taking one node, include it into the shortest path graph, then finding the edge that is the smallest, and take that node that is connected by that edge. Then the algorithm repeats itself until it finds the shortest path.

This algorithm is very similar to Prim's algorithm.

See the file for implmentation details.
